NAME
    RDF::TriN3 - notation 3 extensions for RDF::Trine

DESCRIPTION
    This module extends RDF::Trine in three ways:

    *   Adds a Notation 3 parser.

    *   Adds a Notation 3 serializer.

    *   Provides a subclass of literals to represent Notation 3 formulae.

    Implementing N3 logic and the cwm built-ins is considered outside the
    scope of this module, though I am interested in doing that as part of a
    separate project.

BUGS
    Please report any bugs to <http://rt.cpan.org/>.
